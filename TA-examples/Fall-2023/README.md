# Directory for Fall 2023 TA Examples

## The link in the description of the YouTube video should be a "Raw" GitHub link. 

As long as your file's name doesn't change, the raw link to your code file will provide users with the most up-to-date version of your code (if it's on GitHub.) Therefore, you can make changes after your video has been released without changing the link in the video description. 

## To obtain a raw link, follow these steps:

I'll use mine from Spring 2023 as an example, but you'll navigate to the Fall 2023 projects.

1. **Fork The Art of Making's CPB Repository**
This will create a copy repository under your account that you can edit. You'll eventually request these edits to be added back into The Art of Making's official repository.

Then, click "Create Fork."

2. **Navigate to this Semester's Projects Folder**

I'm using the Spring 2023 folder as an example. For Fall 2023, the directory path will be `TA-examples` --> `Fall-2023`

3. **Click on your Demo Project's Appropriate Directory**

You're done - someone with write access to The Art of Making organization will then approve the pull request to be merged into the main repository.
