## On-demand Guitar

### Use case: 

Ever have nothing better to do than annoy your roommate? The On-demand Guitar allows you to easily play guitar notes so you can jam on while lightly annoying your roommates!

### What it does: 

The On-demand Guitar plays a guitar noise while you tug on a rubber band around your neck and press down on touch pads that can play different notes.

### How it works:

There are three main technical features for the On-demand Guitar: Capactive Touch, a Stretch Sensor, and an Off-board Speaker/Amp. Copper tape connects to the analog pins that are set up for capacitive touch. A conductive rubber band has three wires that connect it to 3.3V, ground, and an analog reader to determine voltage changes as you pull down on the conductive rubber band -- all simulating a stretch sensor. Once you pull down hard enough on the rubber band while pressing down on one of the capactive touch pads, you will hear a guitar note through the off-board speaker!
